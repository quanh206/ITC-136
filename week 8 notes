making scripts programs

variable=data     might need "data"
echo $variable >>> data

df -h    how much space you have available on your filesystem

du -h      disk used (relative to where you are) 

>> redirect outputs into a diff place (echo history >> history.out)

df -h | grep "/dev/sdal" | awk '{print $5}'   grep grabs the line, awk grabs the column
ex: /dev/sdal 16G 5.0G 9.9G 2%
output is just the 2%
diskused=$(df -h | grep "/dev/sdal" | awk '{print $5}')
echo $diskused prints out the same output 2%

env | less  

for a program to be executable it has to be in your "path"

chmod +x    change mode makes a file executable, +x makes it writeable

echo $PATH displays your current path?

to get to the script file

sudo vim /usr/local/bin/stats

# is to make a comment

make a new file and move it to application with added picture
cd ~/Desktop
vim stats.desktop    edit the file with image
sudo chmod +x stats.desktop
sudo mv stats.desktop /usr/share/application
/stats.desktop    change exec to /usr/bin/gnome-terminal -e/usr/local/stats
